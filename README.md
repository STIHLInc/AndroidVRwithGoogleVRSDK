## Technology
### 
[Google VR SDK for Unity](https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/) to handle gyroscope data and the [NatCam Unity plugin]



### Web Viewer
The web viewer is built using WebGL,  [Three](https://threejs.org/), and the emerging WebVR spec via the [polyfill](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill) developed at Google by Boris Smus. Using these open standards allows for an adaptive experience across desktops, tablets, and phones. [WebVR](https://webvr.info) support means Sprayscape’s web experience is ready for VR devices: Cardboard, Daydream, Vive, and Oculus. Additional UI and state management is handled by the lightweight [Choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo) framework.
